# Modeling of egg production and mating
probability for macroparasites
The reproductive habits of macroparasite are important for the
study of the dynamics of their transmission. For populations of para-
sites distributed by Poisson or negative binomial models, these habits
have already been studied. However, other statistical models describe
these populations, such as zero-inflated models, but where reproduc-
tive characteristics were not analyzed. Using an ar- bitrary model
for the parasite population, we model the distribution of females and
males per host, and from these we model the different reproductive
variables such as the mean number of fertile females, the mean egg pro-
duction, the mating probability, and mean fertilized egg production.
We show that these variables change due to the effects of negative
density-dependence fecundity, a characteristic of helminth parasites.
We present the results obtained for particular models.
