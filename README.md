# Modeling of egg production and mating probability for macroparasites
The reproductive habits of the parasites are important for the study of the dynamics of their transmission. For populations of parasites distributed by Poisson or negative binomial models, these habits have already been studied.Â However, other statistical models describe these populations, such as zero-inflated models, but where reproductive characteristics were not analyzed. Using an ar- bitrary model for the parasite population, we model the distribution of females and males per host, and from these we model the different reproductive variables such as the mean number of fertile females, the mean egg production, the mating probability, and mean fertilized egg production. We show that these variables change due to the effects of negative density-dependence fecundity, a characteristic of helminth parasites. We present the results obtained for particular models.
